### Plotting Daily High and Close Price
The highest and close prices are useful what identifying what was the highest the stocks reached daily and at what price the market closed.

### Plotting the Volume Traded
Volume traded basically gives information about the volatility of the stocks. If the lines keep dropping and raising over time the stocks show that they are more volatile.
